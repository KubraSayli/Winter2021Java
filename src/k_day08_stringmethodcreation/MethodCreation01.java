	 	1) We create methods out of the main method and use them in main method to make main method simple
	 	2) The variables which are created in method parenthesis are called "parameters" 
	 	!!!! ss al yaz==> For example num1 and num2
	 	   The values which are used in method call are called "arguments" ==> For example 3, and 5
	 	3) To call a method from inside the main method, use just method name + method parenthesis + arguments
	 	4) "static" methods can use just static class members, because of that if you will call a method from inside the
	 	   main method you have to make it "static"
	 	5) For number parameters you can use "chars" but do not use "String" or "boolean" otherwise you get Compile Time Error.

	 	If you need to use same method name in methods in A CLASS, you have to make parameters different.
	 	To make parameters different we have 3 ways;
	 	 1)Change data type of parameters
	 	 2)Change the number of parameters
	 	 3)If the data types of parameters are different, you may change their order
	 	 
	 	 Note for Interview: 
	 	 	If you create methods whose names are same, parameters are different in a class it is called "method overloading"
	 	 	
	 	 Note: When you use same name for methods in a class, Java complains. To stop complaining you have to change parameters.
	 	       Changing "return type" cannot stop complain	
	 	       Changing "access modifier" cannot stop complain
	 	       Removing or adding "static" keyword cannot stop complain
